# minimdb
Mini IMDB. The movies and TV shows catalogue.

 Quick and dirty demo project featuring the following topics:

* ASP.Net Core backend
  * API built with DI
  * Different configurations for different environments
  * Connected to PostgreSQL database with EF core
  * CRUD operations, pagination, search
  * Authentication and authorization using JWT tokens
  * Data validation
  * In-memory caching example
  * Basic internationalization example with 3 languages
  * Exception handling strategy: it's better to avoid using exceptions or convert them into app specific error objects
  * API documentation using Swagger
* Angular 8 frontend
  * Backend API usage
  * Authentication and Authorization quick and dirty idea
  * Input data validation
  * CRUD operations, pagination, search
  * Basic internationalization example with 3 languages
  * Different configurations for testing purposes
* Docker containerization

## How to build and run
Prerequisites:
* NPM 6+ https://nodejs.org/en/download/
* .NET Core 3.1 https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1
* (Visual Studio 2019 or VS Code)
For development environment I decided to run client app and backend separately.

To run backend run the following commands inside MiniMdb.Backend directory:
```
set ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT Development
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

To run frontend run the following commands inside MiniMdb.Backend/ClientApp directory:

```
npm install
npm run ng serve
```

The app will be available by the url: `https://localhost:5001`

Autogenerated API docs: `https://localhost:5001/swagger`

There could be problems with SSL certificate. (TODO explain how to solve)

## Testing

## Authentication and authorization

There are two hardcoded users:
1. Admin role, `admin@example.com`, `m3g@pA$$W0rDDD`
2. User role, `anyone@example.com`, `w3@kpa$$w0rd`

Admin can do any operation in the app including: creating new titles, editing, removing.
User can't edit or create anything. The only difference from anonymous access is the ability to
see Movie/Series details on a separate page (just a demonstration of authorization policies).
